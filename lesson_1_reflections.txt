How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it will help me very much by showing diffrences between old and new.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Of course yes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros that i am the controller of the version control.
    cons that i might write or make a lot of changes without commiting it which make the things diffrence.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    i don't know.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    i don't know.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    i don't know.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    i want to try every thing.
